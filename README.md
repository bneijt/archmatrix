Matrix of Archlinux based docker images
========================

This is a combination of features in a docker image. Each feature is part of the tag name using snake case:

- **Pyenv39**: Python 3.9 installed using pyenv
- **Tf12**: Terraform 1.2
- **Stipped**: deleted most extra files on the filesystem, nolonger usable to continue development as the shell has been removed
- **A**: adds an `app` user without root privileges
- **Aws**: adds an `aws-cli`

All tags are build as latest, but if you need to go back you there is also a week of the year prefix number available.

An example is `01Tf12Aws` which is the build from the first week of the year, with Terraform 1.2 and AWS CLI.

Development
===========
The docker files in `tags/` are generated by a Rust program. See [`generate.sh`](generate.sh) for more information.
